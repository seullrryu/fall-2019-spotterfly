# Spotterfly

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nyu-software-engineering/fall-2019-spotterfly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nyu-software-engineering/fall-2019-spotterfly)

## Overview
Find music you like by letting the music find you. Spotterfly connects you with people nearby who share similar music taste. Login using your spotify credentials. Spotterfly will pull your top tracks and top artists, along with your location. Once that happens, it will show you a list of users around you with similar top artists or top tracks, and will allow you to take a look at the library of that user near you with similar music taste. 

## How to install
1. Clone git repo to your local machine
2. cd to fall-2019-spotterfly/client
3. Run `npm install`
4. Now you should be able to run the client with `npm start`
5. On another terminal, cd to fall-2019-spotterfly/backend
6. Run `npm install`
7. Now you should be able to run backend with `npm start`
8. If you haven't already, run `npm start` on both client and backend
9. Open your browser to localhost:3000


## Debugging common npm issues
Sometimes the package-lock.json have conflicts with existing versions. If you run into errors like `Unexpected string in JSON`, remove the package-lock.json file with `rm package-lock.json` and reinstall npm with `npm install`.


## Project specifics
Since our project is based on matching spotify playlist, you will need a spotify account to use our services. Please create a spotify account here https://www.spotify.com/us/signup/. Also, you will need to enable gps location so please do so when the prompt comes up. It may not load on the first visit, so reload your webpage after allowing gps permissions.
