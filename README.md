## Project specifics

Since our project is based on matching spotify playlist, you will need a spotify account to use our services. Please create a spotify account here https://www.spotify.com/us/signup/. Also, you will need to enable gps location so please do so when the prompt comes up. It may not load on the first visit, so reload your webpage after allowing gps permissions.
